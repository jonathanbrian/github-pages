Giraffes: Welcome to my blog about giraffes

Giraffes are fascinating creatures! They are the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth1. They belong to the genus Giraffa and are native to Africa. Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. However, recent research has proposed dividing them into up to eight extant species.
Giraffes have an extremely elongated neck, which can be up to 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in) in length1. Along the neck is a mane made of short, erect hairs. The neck typically rests at an angle of 50â€“60 degrees, though juveniles are closer to 70 degrees1.
